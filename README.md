# Stock-Market-Predictor
Made a Stock Market Predictor Webapp that predicts the market graph using 50 days moving average and shows the real vs predicted trend. Moreover, this is dynamic and works for various companies and stocks. Built the model using pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot,  pandas_datareader, plotly.express, streamlit, requests, streamlit_lottie ,keras.models, tensorflow. The sequential model uses Dense Droput and LSTM for prediction. 


Use streamlit run appy.py in command line in same folder
